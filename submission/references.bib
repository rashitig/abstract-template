abstract = {After decades of massive digitisation, an unprecedented number of historical documents are available in digital format, along with their machine-readable texts. While this represents a major step forward with respect to preservation and accessibility, it also opens up new opportunities in terms of content mining and the next fundamental challenge is to develop appropriate technologies to efficiently search, retrieve, and explore information from this ‘big data of the past’. Among semantic indexing opportunities, the recognition and classification of named entities are in great demand among humanities scholars. Yet, named entity recognition (NER) systems are heavily challenged with diverse, historical, and noisy inputs. In this survey, we present the array of challenges posed by historical documents to NER, inventory existing resources, describe the main approaches deployed so far, and identify key priorities for future developments.},

    abstract = "We propose a novel deep learning model for joint document-level entity disambiguation, which leverages learned neural representations. Key components are entity embeddings, a neural attention mechanism over local context windows, and a differentiable joint inference stage for disambiguation. Our approach thereby combines benefits of deep learning with more traditional approaches such as graphical models and probabilistic mention-entity maps. Extensive experiments show that we are able to obtain competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy at moderate computational costs.",

  abstract="The huge amount of textual user-generated content on the Web has incredibly grown in the last decade, creating new relevant opportunities for different real-world applications and domains. In particular, microblogging platforms enables the collection of continuously and instantly updated information. The organization and extraction of valuable knowledge from these contents are fundamental for ensuring profitability and efficiency to companies and institutions. This paper presents an unsupervised model for the task of Named Entity Linking in microblogging environments. The aim is to link the named entity mentions in a text with their corresponding knowledge-base entries exploiting a novel heterogeneous representation space characterized by more meaningful similarity measures between words and named entities, obtained by Word Embeddings. The proposed model has been evaluated on different benchmark datasets proposed for Named Entity Linking challenges for English and Italian language. It obtains very promising performance given the highly challenging environment of user-generated content over microblogging platforms.",
